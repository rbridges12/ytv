# Youtube Terminal Viewer
**ytv**, aka youtube terminal viewer, is a command line application that lets you watch youtube (and other) videos right from the comfort of your own terminal. It uses youtube-dl to download your desired video, then renders it in ASCII text for your viewing pleasure.

## Installation
Install `youtube-dl` by following the instructions [here](https://github.com/ytdl-org/youtube-dl#readme), then just clone or download this repository.

## Usage
`./ytv [URL]`

You can watch videos from any site supported by youtube-dl, [listed here](https://ytdl-org.github.io/youtube-dl/supportedsites.html).

Any terminal size is supported, but you should zoom out for best results.
